# Helmet-Detection-using-YOLO
I have used a pretrained YOLO model to detect helmet in an image using Pytorch.
There is a yolo.cfg file which contains information about all layers of neural network.
There is a helmet.names file which contains labels.
yolo.weights contains the weights of pretrained YOLO model.
The notebook contains detailed explanation of each step in the process.
I hope you will enjoy!
