# Helmet-Detection-using-YOLO
I have used a pretrained YOLO model to detect helmet in an image using Pytorch.
There is a yolo.cfg file which contains information about all layers of neural network.
There is a helmet.names file which contains labels.
yolo.weights contains the weights of pretrained YOLO model.
The notebook contains detailed explanation of each step in the process.
The dataset can be downloaded here https://www.kaggle.com/savanagrawal/helmet-detection-yolov3
I hope you will enjoy!
